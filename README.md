Motivation

The oil market influences nearly all aspects of our lives. At large, nearly every industry, if not all depend on it in some way. Oil is not only used to power vehicles, but it is also used in production of many goods, such as plastic, including nylon and polyester clothing, rubber, and hundreds of other intermediate and end-user goods. In 2017, U.S. consumed 19.96 million barrels per day on average. Since oil is not a renewable source of energy, it will run out someday. Since the demand for it is increasing, while supply is diminishing, it is likely that the oil prices will rise.


Description of data

The chosen dataset presents Brent oil price per gallon since May 1987 to October 2018. The overall trend is showing that oil prices are rising. I decided to choose Brent oil because it is one of the most recognizable brands, which is why it is reasonable to assume that this sector is the most reflective in terms of oil prices. The dataset is taken from United States Energy Information Administration, which is why this data may be considered accurate.
 
 
 
Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to estimate the price for Brent using Machine Learning. In order to predict the prices in the given dataset, I plan to use time series regression (ADL model). The price estimation is planned to predict petroleum and diesel prices from October 15, 2018 to November 15, 2019. It would be interesting to compare the estimation from the model with the actual data from EIA, which I will recover closer to the date of the course project presentation. The reason why I only make a prediction for one month is because to realistically estimate the price, it is important to account for unpredictable events such as new oil field discoveries and etc.
